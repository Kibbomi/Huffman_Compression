Silence fell upon the room where the boy 

and woman sat together. Again, as on the 

other evenings, they were embarrassed. 

After a time the boy tried again to 

talk. ?I suppose it won?t be for a year 

or two but I?ve been thinking about it,? 

he said, rising and going toward the 

door. ?Something father said makes it 

sure that I shall have to go away.? He 

fumbled with the doorknob. In the room 

the silence became unbearable to the 

woman. She wanted to cry out with joy 

because of the words that had come from 

the lips of her son, but the expression 

of joy had become impossible to her. ?I 

think you had better go out among the 

boys. You are too much indoors,? she 

said. ?I thought I would go for a little 

walk,? replied the son stepping 

awkwardly out of the room and closing 

the door. DEPARTURE

Young George Willard got out of bed at 

four in the morning. It was April and 

the young tree leaves were just coming 

out of their buds. The trees along the 

residence streets in Winesburg are maple 

and the seeds are winged. When the wind 

blows they whirl crazily about, filling 

the air and making a carpet underfoot. 

George came downstairs into the hotel 

office carrying a brown leather bag. His 

trunk was packed for departure. Since 

two o?clock he had been awake thinking 

of the journey he was about to take and 

wondering what he would find at the end 

of his journey. The boy who slept in the 

hotel office lay on a cot by the door. 

His mouth was open and he snored 

lustily. George crept past the cot and 

went out into the silent deserted main 

street. The east was pink with the dawn 

and long streaks of light climbed into 

the sky where a few stars still shone. 

Beyond the last house on Trunion Pike in 

Winesburg there is a great stretch of 

open fields. The fields are owned by 

farmers who live in town and drive 

homeward at evening along Trunion Pike 

in light creaking wagons. In the fields 

are planted berries and small fruits. In 

the late afternoon in the hot summers 

when the road and the fields are covered 

with dust, a smoky haze lies over the 

great flat basin of land. To look across 

it is like looking out across the sea. 

In the spring when the land is green the 

effect is somewhat different. The land 

becomes a wide green billiard table on 

which tiny human insects toil up and 

down. 

All through his boyhood and young 

manhood George Willard had been in the 

habit of walking on Trunion Pike. He had 

been in the midst of the great open 

place on winter nights when it was 

covered with snow and only the moon 

looked down at him he had been there in 

the fall when bleak winds blew and on 

summer evenings when the air vibrated 

with the song of insects. On the April 

morning he wanted to go there again, to 

walk again in the silence. He did walk 

to where the road dipped down by a 

little stream two miles from town and 

then turned and walked silently back 

again. When he got to Main Street clerks 

were sweeping the sidewalks before the 

stores. ?Hey, you George. How does it 

feel to be going away?? they asked. 

The westbound train leaves Winesburg at 

seven fortyfive in the morning. Tom 

Little is conductor. His train runs from 

Cleveland to where it connects with a 

great trunk line railroad with terminals 

in Chicago and New York. Tom has what in 

railroad circles is called an ?easy 

run.? Every evening he returns to his 

family. In the fall and spring he spends 

his Sundays fishing in Lake Erie. He has 

a round red face and small blue eyes. He 

knows the people in the towns along his 

railroad better than a city man knows 

the people who live in his apartment 

building. 

George came down the little incline from 

the New Willard House at seven o?clock. 

Tom Willard carried his bag. The son had 

become taller than the father. 

On the station platform everyone shook 

the young man?s hand. More than a dozen 

people waited about. Then they talked of 

their own affairs. Even Will Henderson, 

who was lazy and often slept until nine, 

had got out of bed. George was 

embarrassed. Gertrude Wilmot, a tall 

thin woman of fifty who worked in the 

Winesburg post office, came along the 

station platform. She had never before 

paid any attention to George. Now she 

stopped and put out her hand. In two 

words she voiced what everyone felt. ?

Good luck,? she said sharply and then 

turning went on her way. 

When the train came into the station 

George felt relieved. He scampered 

hurriedly aboard. Helen White came 

running along Main Street hoping to have 

a parting word with him, but he had 

found a seat and did not see her. When 

the train started Tom Little punched his 

ticket, grinned and, although he knew 

George well and knew on what adventure 

he was just setting out, made no 

comment. Tom had seen a thousand George 

Willards go out of their towns to the 

city. It was a commonplace enough 

incident with him. In the smoking car 

there was a man who had just invited Tom 

to go on a fishing trip to Sandusky Bay. 

He wanted to accept the invitation and 

talk over details. 

George glanced up and down the car to be 

sure no one was looking, then took out 

his pocketbook and counted his money. 

His mind was occupied with a desire not 

to appear green. Almost the last words 

his father had said to him concerned the 

matter of his behavior when he got to 

the city. ?Be a sharp one,? Tom Willard 

had said. ?Keep your eyes on your money. 

Be awake. That?s the ticket. Don?t let 

anyone think you?re a greenhorn.? 

After George counted his money he looked 

out of the window and was surprised to 

see that the train was still in 

Winesburg. 

The young man, going out of his town to 

meet the adventure of life, began to 

think but he did not think of anything 

very big or dramatic. Things like his 

mother?s death, his departure from 

Winesburg, the uncertainty of his future 

life in the city, the serious and larger 

aspects of his life did not come into 

his mind. 

He thought of little things?Turk Smollet 

THE BOOK OF THE GROTESQUE


The writer, an old man with a white 

mustache, had some difficulty in getting 

into bed. The windows of the house in 

which he lived were high and he wanted 

to look at the trees when he awoke in 

the morning. A carpenter came to fix the 

bed so that it would be on a level with 

the window. 

Quite a fuss was made about the matter. 

The carpenter, who had been a soldier in 

the Civil War, came into the writer?s 

room and sat down to talk of building a 

platform for the purpose of raising the 

bed. The writer had cigars lying about 

and the carpenter smoked. 

For a time the two men talked of the 

raising of the bed and then they talked 

of other things. The soldier got on the 

subject of the war. The writer, in fact, 

led him to that subject. The carpenter 

had once been a prisoner in 

Andersonville prison and had lost a 

brother. The brother had died of 

starvation, and whenever the carpenter 

got upon that subject he cried. He, like 

the old writer, had a white mustache, 

and when he cried he puckered up his 

lips and the mustache bobbed up and 

down. The weeping old man with the cigar 

in his mouth was ludicrous. The plan the 

writer had for the raising of his bed 

was forgotten and later the carpenter 

did it in his own way and the writer, 

who was past sixty, had to help himself 

with a chair when he went to bed at 

night. 

In his bed the writer rolled over on his 

side and lay quite still. For years he 

had been beset with notions concerning 

his heart. He was a hard smoker and his 

heart fluttered. The idea had got into 

his mind that he would some time die 

unexpectedly and always when he got into 

bed he thought of that. It did not alarm 

him. The effect in fact was quite a 

special thing and not easily explained. 

It made him more alive, there in bed, 

than at any other time. Perfectly still 

he lay and his body was old and not of 

much use any more, but something inside 

him was altogether young. He was like a 

pregnant woman, only that the thing 

inside him was not a baby but a youth. 

No, it wasn?t a youth, it was a woman, 

young, and wearing a coat of mail like a 

knight. It is absurd, you see, to try to 

tell what was inside the old writer as 

he lay on his high bed and listened to 

the fluttering of his heart. The thing 

to get at is what the writer, or the 

young thing within the writer, was 

thinking about. 

The old writer, like all of the people 

in the world, had got, during his long 

fife, a great many notions in his head. 

He had once been quite handsome and a 

number of women had been in love with 

him. And then, of course, he had known 

people, many people, known them in a 

peculiarly intimate way that was 

different from the way in which you and 

I know people. At least that is what the 

writer thought and the thought pleased 

him. Why quarrel with an old man 

concerning his thoughts? 

In the bed the writer had a dream that 

was not a dream. As he grew somewhat 

sleepy but was still conscious, figures 

began to appear before his eyes. He 

imagined the young indescribable thing 

within himself was driving a long 

procession of figures before his eyes. 

You see the interest in all this lies in 

the figures that went before the eyes of 

the writer. They were all grotesques. 

All of the men and women the writer had 

ever known had become grotesques. 

The grotesques were not all horrible. 

Some were amusing, some almost 

beautiful, and one, a woman all drawn 

out of shape, hurt the old man by her 

grotesqueness. When she passed he made a 

noise like a small dog whimpering. Had 

you come into the room you might have 

supposed the old man had unpleasant 

dreams or perhaps indigestion. 

For an hour the procession of grotesques 

passed before the eyes of the old man, 

and then, although it was a painful 

thing to do, he crept out of bed and 

began to write. Some one of the 

grotesques had made a deep impression on 

his mind and he wanted to describe it. 

At his desk the writer worked for an 

hour. In the end he wrote a book which 

he called ?The Book of the Grotesque.? 

It was never published, but I saw it 

once and it made an indelible impression 

on my mind. The book had one central 

thought that is very strange and has 

always remained with me. By remembering 

it I have been able to understand many 

people and things that I was never able 

to understand before. The thought was 

involved but a simple statement of it 

would be something like this 

That in the beginning when the world was 

young there were a great many thoughts 

but no such thing as a truth. Man made 

the truths himself and each truth was a 

composite of a great many vague 

thoughts. All about in the world were 

the truths and they were all beautiful. 

The old man had listed hundreds of the 

truths in his book. I will not try to 

tell you of all of them. There was the 

truth of virginity and the truth of 

passion, the truth of wealth and of 

poverty, of thrift and of profligacy, of 

carelessness and abandon. Hundreds and 

hundreds were the truths and they were 

all beautiful. 

And then the people came along. Each as 

he appeared snatched up one of the 

truths and some who were quite strong 

snatched up a dozen of them. 

It was the truths that made the people 

grotesques. The old man had quite an 

elaborate theory concerning the matter. 

It was his notion that the moment one of 

the people took one of the truths to 

HANDS

Upon the half decayed veranda of a small 

frame house that stood near the edge of 

a ravine near the town of Winesburg, 

Ohio, a fat little old man walked 

nervously up and down. Across a long 

field that had been seeded for clover 

but that had produced only a dense crop 

of yellow mustard weeds, he could see 

the public highway along which went a 

wagon filled with berry pickers 

returning from the fields. The berry 

pickers, youths and maidens, laughed and 

shouted boisterously. A boy clad in a 

blue shirt leaped from the wagon and 

attempted to drag after him one of the 

maidens, who screamed and protested 

shrilly. The feet of the boy in the road 

kicked up a cloud of dust that floated 

across the face of the departing sun. 

Over the long field came a thin girlish 

voice. ?Oh, you Wing Biddlebaum, comb 

your hair, it?s falling into your eyes,? 

commanded the voice to the man, who was 

bald and whose nervous little hands 

fiddled about the bare white forehead as 

though arranging a mass of tangled 

locks. 

Wing Biddlebaum, forever frightened and 

beset by a ghostly band of doubts, did 

not think of himself as in any way a 

part of the life of the town where he 

had lived for twenty years. Among all 

the people of Winesburg but one had come 

close to him. With George Willard, son 

of Tom Willard, the proprietor of the 

New Willard House, he had formed 

something like a friendship. George 

Willard was the reporter on the 

Winesburg Eagle and sometimes in the 

evenings he walked out along the highway 

to Wing Biddlebaum?s house. Now as the 

old man walked up and down on the 

veranda, his hands moving nervously 

about, he was hoping that George Willard 

would come and spend the evening with 

him. After the wagon containing the 

berry pickers had passed, he went across 

the field through the tall mustard weeds 

and climbing a rail fence peered 

anxiously along the road to the town. 

For a moment he stood thus, rubbing his 

hands together and looking up and down 

the road, and then, fear overcoming him, 

ran back to walk again upon the porch on 

his own house. 

In the presence of George Willard, Wing 

Biddlebaum, who for twenty years had 

been the town mystery, lost something of 

his timidity, and his shadowy 

personality, submerged in a sea of 

doubts, came forth to look at the world. 

With the young reporter at his side, he 

ventured in the light of day into Main 

Street or strode up and down on the 

rickety front porch of his own house, 

talking excitedly. The voice that had 

been low and trembling became shrill and 

loud. The bent figure straightened. With 

a kind of wriggle, like a fish returned 

to the brook by the fisherman, 

Biddlebaum the silent began to talk, 

striving to put into words the ideas 

that had been accumulated by his mind 

during long years of silence. 

Wing Biddlebaum talked much with his 

hands. The slender expressive fingers, 

forever active, forever striving to 

conceal themselves in his pockets or 

behind his back, came forth and became 

the piston rods of his machinery of 

expression. 

The story of Wing Biddlebaum is a story 

of hands. Their restless activity, like 

unto the beating of the wings of an 

imprisoned bird, had given him his name. 

Some obscure poet of the town had 

thought of it. The hands alarmed their 

owner. He wanted to keep them hidden 

away and looked with amazement at the 

quiet inexpressive hands of other men 

who worked beside him in the fields, or 

passed, driving sleepy teams on country 

roads. 

When he talked to George Willard, Wing 

Biddlebaum closed his fists and beat 

with them upon a table or on the walls 

of his house. The action made him more 

comfortable. If the desire to talk came 

to him when the two were walking in the 

fields, he sought out a stump or the top 

board of a fence and with his hands 

pounding busily talked with renewed 

ease. 

The story of Wing Biddlebaum?s hands is 

worth a book in itself. Sympathetically 

set forth it would tap many strange, 

beautiful qualities in obscure men. It 

is a job for a poet. In Winesburg the 

hands had attracted attention merely 

because of their activity. With them 

Wing Biddlebaum had picked as high as a 

hundred and forty quarts of strawberries 

in a day. They became his distinguishing 

feature, the source of his fame. Also 

they made more grotesque an already 

grotesque and elusive individuality. 

Winesburg was proud of the hands of Wing 

Biddlebaum in the same spirit in which 

it was proud of Banker White?s new stone 

house and Wesley Moyer?s bay stallion, 

Tony Tip, that had won the twofifteen 

trot at the fall races in Cleveland. 

As for George Willard, he had many times 

wanted to ask about the hands. At times 

an almost overwhelming curiosity had 

taken hold of him. He felt that there 

must be a reason for their strange 

activity and their inclination to keep 

hidden away and only a growing respect 

for Wing Biddlebaum kept him from 

blurting out the questions that were 

often in his mind. 

Once he had been on the point of asking. 

The two were walking in the fields on a 

summer afternoon and had stopped to sit 

upon a grassy bank. All afternoon Wing 

Biddlebaum had talked as one inspired. 

By a fence he had stopped and beating 

like a giant woodpecker upon the top 

board had shouted at George Willard, 

condemning his tendency to be too much 

influenced by the people about him. ?You 

are destroying yourself,? he cried. ?You 

have the inclination to be alone and to 

dream and you are afraid of dreams. You 

want to be like others in town here. You 

hear them talk and you try to imitate 

them.? 

On the grassy bank Wing Biddlebaum had 

tried again to drive his point home. His 

voice became soft and reminiscent, and 

with a sigh of contentment he launched 

into a long rambling talk, speaking as 

one lost in a dream. 

Out of the dream Wing Biddlebaum made a 

picture for George Willard. In the 

picture men lived again in a kind of 

pastoral golden age. Across a green open 

country came cleanlimbed young men, 

some afoot, some mounted upon horses. In 

crowds the young men came to gather 

about the feet of an old man who sat 

beneath a tree in a tiny garden and who 

talked to them. 

Wing Biddlebaum became wholly inspired. 

For once he forgot the hands. Slowly 

they stole forth and lay upon George 

Willard?s shoulders. Something new and 

bold came into the voice that talked. ?

You must try to forget all you have 

learned,? said the old man. ?You must 

begin to dream. From this time on you 

must shut your ears to the roaring of 

the voices.? 

Pausing in his speech, Wing Biddlebaum 

looked long and earnestly at George 

Willard. His eyes glowed. Again he 

raised the hands to caress the boy and 

then a look of horror swept over his 

face. 

With a convulsive movement of his body, 

Wing Biddlebaum sprang to his feet and 

thrust his hands deep into his trousers 

pockets. Tears came to his eyes. ?I must 

be getting along home. I can talk no 

more with you,? he said nervously. 

Without looking back, the old man had 

hurried down the hillside and across a 

meadow, leaving George Willard perplexed 

and frightened upon the grassy slope. 

With a shiver of dread the boy arose and 

went along the road toward town. ?I?ll 

not ask him about his hands,? he 

thought, touched by the memory of the 

terror he had seen in the man?s eyes. ?

There?s something wrong, but I don?t 

want to know what it is. His hands have 

something to do with his fear of me and 

of everyone.? 

And George Willard was right. Let us 

look briefly into the story of the 

hands. Perhaps our talking of them will 

arouse the poet who will tell the hidden 

wonder story of the influence for which 

the hands were but fluttering pennants 

of promise. 

In his youth Wing Biddlebaum had been a 

school teacher in a town in 

Pennsylvania. He was not then known as 

Wing Biddlebaum, but went by the less 

euphonic name of Adolph Myers. As Adolph 

Myers he was much loved by the boys of 

his school. 

Adolph Myers was meant by nature to be a 

teacher of youth. He was one of those 

rare, littleunderstood men who rule by 

a power so gentle that it passes as a 

lovable weakness. In their feeling for 

the boys under their charge such men are 

not unlike the finer sort of women in 

their love of men. 

And yet that is but crudely stated. It 

needs the poet there. With the boys of 

his school, Adolph Myers had walked in 

the evening or had sat talking until 

dusk upon the schoolhouse steps lost in 

a kind of dream. Here and there went his 

hands, caressing the shoulders of the 

boys, playing about the tousled heads. 

As he talked his voice became soft and 

musical. There was a caress in that 

also. In a way the voice and the hands, 

the stroking of the shoulders and the 

touching of the hair were a part of the 

schoolmaster?s effort to carry a dream 

into the young minds. By the caress that 

was in his fingers he expressed himself. 

He was one of those men in whom the 

force that creates life is diffused, not 

centralized. Under the caress of his 

hands doubt and disbelief went out of 

the minds of the boys and they began 

also to dream. 

And then the tragedy. A halfwitted boy 

of the school became enamored of the 

young master. In his bed at night he 

imagined unspeakable things and in the 

morning went forth to tell his dreams as 

facts. Strange, hideous accusations fell 

from his loosehung lips. Through the 

Pennsylvania town went a shiver. Hidden, 

shadowy doubts that had been in men?s 

minds concerning Adolph Myers were 

galvanized into beliefs. 

The tragedy did not linger. Trembling 

lads were jerked out of bed and 

questioned. ?He put his arms about me,? 

said one. ?His fingers were always 

playing in my hair,? said another. 

One afternoon a man of the town, Henry 

Bradford, who kept a saloon, came to the 

schoolhouse door. Calling Adolph Myers 

into the school yard he began to beat 

him with his fists. As his hard knuckles 

beat down into the frightened face of 

the schoolmaster, his wrath became more 

and more terrible. Screaming with 

dismay, the children ran here and there 

like disturbed insects. ?I?ll teach you 

to put your hands on my boy, you beast,? 

roared the saloon keeper, who, tired of 

beating the master, had begun to kick 

him about the yard. 

Adolph Myers was driven from the 

Pennsylvania town in the night. With 

lanterns in their hands a dozen men came 

to the door of the house where he lived 

alone and commanded that he dress and 

come forth. It was raining and one of 

the men had a rope in his hands. They 

had intended to hang the schoolmaster, 

but something in his figure, so small, 

white, and pitiful, touched their hearts 

and they let him escape. As he ran away 

into the darkness they repented of their 

weakness and ran after him, swearing and 

throwing sticks and great balls of soft 

mud at the figure that screamed and ran 

faster and faster into the darkness. 

For twenty years Adolph Myers had lived 

alone in Winesburg. He was but forty but 

looked sixtyfive. The name of 

Biddlebaum he got from a box of goods 

seen at a freight station as he hurried 

through an eastern Ohio town. He had an 

aunt in Winesburg, a blacktoothed old 

woman who raised chickens, and with her 

he lived until she died. He had been ill 

for a year after the experience in 

Pennsylvania, and after his recovery 

worked as a day laborer in the fields, 

going timidly about and striving to 

conceal his hands. Although he did not 

understand what had happened he felt 

that the hands must be to blame. Again 

and again the fathers of the boys had 

talked of the hands. ?Keep your hands to 

yourself,? the saloon keeper had roared, 

dancing, with fury in the schoolhouse 

yard. 

Upon the veranda of his house by the 

ravine, Wing Biddlebaum continued to 

walk up and down until the sun had 

disappeared and the road beyond the 

field was lost in the grey shadows. 

Going into his house he cut slices of 

bread and spread honey upon them. When 

the rumble of the evening train that 

took away the express cars loaded with 

the day?s harvest of berries had passed 

and restored the silence of the summer 

night, he went again to walk upon the 

veranda. In the darkness he could not 

see the hands and they became quiet. He 

was an old man with a white beard and 

huge nose and hands. Long before the 

time during which we will know him, he 

was a doctor and drove a jaded white 

horse from house to house through the 

streets of Winesburg. Later he married a 

girl who had money. She had been left a 

large fertile farm when her father died. 

The girl was quiet, tall, and dark, and 

to many people she seemed very 

beautiful. Everyone in Winesburg 

wondered why she married the doctor. 

Within a year after the marriage she 

died. 

The knuckles of the doctor?s hands were 

extraordinarily large. When the hands 

were closed they looked like clusters of 

unpainted wooden balls as large as 

walnuts fastened together by steel rods. 

He smoked a cob pipe and after his 

wife?s death sat all day in his empty 

office close by a window that was 

covered with cobwebs. He never opened 

the window. Once on a hot day in August 

he tried but found it stuck fast and 

after that he forgot all about it. 

Winesburg had forgotten the old man, but 

in Doctor Reefy there were the seeds of 

something very fine. Alone in his musty 

office in the Heffner Block above the 

Paris Dry Goods Company?s store, he 

worked ceaselessly, building up 

something that he himself destroyed. 

Little pyramids of truth he erected and 

after erecting knocked them down again 

that he might have the truths to erect 

other pyramids. 

Doctor Reefy was a tall man who had worn 

one suit of clothes for ten years. It 

was frayed at the sleeves and little 

holes had appeared at the knees and 

elbows. In the office he wore also a 

linen duster with huge pockets into 

which he continually stuffed scraps of 

paper. After some weeks the scraps of 

paper became little hard round balls, 

and when the pockets were filled he 

dumped them out upon the floor. For ten 

years he had but one friend, another old 

man named John Spaniard who owned a tree 

nursery. Sometimes, in a playful mood, 

old Doctor Reefy took from his pockets a 

handful of the paper balls and threw 

them at the nursery man. ?That is to 

confound you, you blathering old 

sentimentalist,? he cried, shaking with 

laughter. 

The story of Doctor Reefy and his 

courtship of the tall dark girl who 

became his wife and left her money to 

him is a very curious story. It is 

delicious, like the twisted little 

apples that grow in the orchards of 

Winesburg. In the fall one walks in the 

orchards and the ground is hard with 

frost underfoot. The apples have been 

taken from the trees by the pickers. 

They have been put in barrels and 

shipped to the cities where they will be 

eaten in apartments that are filled with 

books, magazines, furniture, and people. 

On the trees are only a few gnarled 

apples that the pickers have rejected. 

They look like the knuckles of Doctor 

Reefy?s hands. One nibbles at them and 

they are delicious. Into a little round 

place at the side of the apple has been 

gathered all of its sweetness. One runs 

from tree to tree over the frosted 

ground picking the gnarled, twisted 

apples and filling his pockets with 

them. Only the few know the sweetness of 

the twisted apples. 

The girl and Doctor Reefy began their 

courtship on a summer afternoon. He was 

fortyfive then and already he had begun 

the practice of filling his pockets with 

the scraps of paper that became hard 

balls and were thrown away. The habit 

had been formed as he sat in his buggy 

behind the jaded white horse and went 

slowly along country roads. On the 

papers were written thoughts, ends of 

thoughts, beginnings of thoughts. 

One by one the mind of Doctor Reefy had 

made the thoughts. Out of many of them 

he formed a truth that arose gigantic in 

his mind. The truth clouded the world. 

It became terrible and then faded away 

and the little thoughts began again. 

The tall dark girl came to see Doctor 

Reefy because she was in the family way 

and had become frightened. She was in 

that condition because of a series of 

circumstances also curious. 

The death of her father and mother and 

the rich acres of land that had come 

down to her had set a train of suitors 

on her heels. For two years she saw 

suitors almost every evening. Except two 

they were all alike. They talked to her 

of passion and there was a strained 

eager quality in their voices and in 

their eyes when they looked at her. The 

two who were different were much unlike 

each other. One of them, a slender young 

man with white hands, the son of a 

jeweler in Winesburg, talked continually 

of virginity. When he was with her he 

was never off the subject. The other, a 

blackhaired boy with large ears, said 

nothing at all but always managed to get 

her into the darkness, where he began to 

kiss her. 

For a time the tall dark girl thought 

she would marry the jeweler?s son. For 

hours she sat in silence listening as he 

talked to her and then she began to be 

afraid of something. Beneath his talk of 

virginity she began to think there was a 

lust greater than in all the others. At 

times it seemed to her that as he talked 

he was holding her body in his hands. 

She imagined him turning it slowly about 

in the white hands and staring at it. At 

night she dreamed that he had bitten 

into her body and that his jaws were 

dripping. She had the dream three times, 

then she became in the family way to the 

one who said nothing at all but who in 

the moment of his passion actually did 

bite her shoulder so that for days the 

marks of his teeth showed. 

After the tall dark girl came to know 

Doctor Reefy it seemed to her that she 

never wanted to leave him again. She 

went into his office one morning and 

without her saying anything he seemed to 

know what had happened to her. 

In the office of the doctor there was a 

woman, the wife of the man who kept the 

bookstore in Winesburg. Like all old

fashioned country practitioners, Doctor 

Reefy pulled teeth, and the woman who 

waited held a handkerchief to her teeth 

and groaned. Her husband was with her 

and when the tooth was taken out they 

both screamed and blood ran down on the 

woman?s white dress. The tall dark girl 

did not pay any attention. When the 

woman and the man had gone the doctor 

smiled. ?I will take you driving into 

the country with me,? he said. 

For several weeks the tall dark girl and 

the doctor were together almost every 

day. The condition that had brought her 

to him passed in an illness, but she was 

like one who has discovered the 

sweetness of the twisted apples, she 

could not get her mind fixed again upon 

the round perfect fruit that is eaten in 

the city apartments. In the fall after 

the beginning of her acquaintanceship 

with him she married Doctor Reefy and in 

the following spring she died. During 

the winter he read to her all of the 

odds and ends of thoughts he had 

scribbled on the bits of paper. After he 

had read them he laughed and stuffed 

them away in his pockets to become round 

hard balls. Although he still hungered 

for the presence of the boy, who was the 

medium through which he expressed his 

love of man, the hunger became again a 

part of his loneliness and his waiting. 

Lighting a lamp, Wing Biddlebaum washed 

the few dishes soiled by his simple meal 

and, setting up a folding cot by the 

screen door that led to the porch, 

prepared to undress for the night. A few 

stray white bread crumbs lay on the 

cleanly washed floor by the table 

putting the lamp upon a low stool he 

began to pick up the crumbs, carrying 

them to his mouth one by one with 

unbelievable rapidity. In the dense 

blotch of light beneath the table, the 

kneeling figure looked like a priest 

engaged in some service of his church. 

The nervous expressive fingers, flashing 

in and out of the light, might well have 

been mistaken for the fingers of the 

devotee going swiftly through decade 

after decade of his rosary.himself, 

called it his truth, and tried to live 

his life by it, he became a grotesque 

and the truth he embraced became a 

falsehood. 

You can see for yourself how the old 

man, who had spent all of his life 

writing and was filled with words, would 

write hundreds of pages concerning this 

matter. The subject would become so big 

in his mind that he himself would be in 

danger of becoming a grotesque. He 

didn?t, I suppose, for the same reason 

that he never published the book. It was 

the young thing inside him that saved 

the old man. 

Concerning the old carpenter who fixed 

the bed for the writer, I only mentioned 

him because he, like many of what are 

called very common people, became the 

nearest thing to what is understandable 

and lovable of all the grotesques in the 

writer?s book. wheeling boards through 

the main street of his town in the 

morning, a tall woman, beautifully 

gowned, who had once stayed overnight at 

his father?s hotel, Butch Wheeler the 

lamp lighter of Winesburg hurrying 

through the streets on a summer evening 

and holding a torch in his hand, Helen 

White standing by a window in the 

Winesburg post office and putting a 

stamp on an envelope. 

The young man?s mind was carried away by 

his growing passion for dreams. One 

looking at him would not have thought 

him particularly sharp. With the 

recollection of little things occupying 

his mind he closed his eyes and leaned 

back in the car seat. He stayed that way 

for a long time and when he aroused 

himself and again looked out of the car 

window the town of Winesburg had 

disappeared and his life there had 

become but a background on which to 

paint the dreams of his manhood.South 

Korean President Moon Jaein vowed 

on Thursday to pursue New South Policy

 to significantly foster Seouls 

cooperative ties with the Association of 

Southeast Asian Nations, which includes 

Indonesia and nine other Southeast Asian 

countries. The policy is aimed at 

actively expanding diplomatic and 

security cooperation with the Southeast 

Asian region and promoting economic 

exchanges and trade.
He made the announcement at a South 

KoreaIndonesia business forum in 

Jakarta during his state visit to the 

Southeast Asian country. Bringing 

South Koreas relationship with ASEAN to 

the level of its relationship with the 

four major powers (the United States, 

Japan, China and Russia) around the 

Korean Peninsula is my goal, he said. 

He also proposed a 3Ps strategy, 

referring to people community, peace 

and prosperity.
His intention is to broaden Seouls 

diplomatic horizon by expanding 

exchanges with the ASEAN nations while 

diversifying South Koreas trade that 

has been concentrated on the United 

States and China. The Moon 

administration plans to diversity Seoul

s diplomacy and establish new economic 

channels with the New South Policy, 

which follows Moons New North Policy

 announced during his visit to Russia 

in September.
Moon announced the New South Policy 

in Indonesia in consideration of the 

fact that Jakarta is a central country 

in the ASEAN. He also proposed what he 

called a sixpoint action plan, which 

includes restoring the frame of economic 

cooperation between the two countries, 

diversifying the areas of economic 

cooperation, promoting cooperation in 

key industries as well as expanding 

bilateral ties to cultural and personnel 

exchanges. Through the action plan, 

Seoul seeks to drastically increase 

trade with ASEAN member nations.
Seoul will seek to increase trade with 

the ASEAN to 200 billion U.S. dollars by 

2022, a similar level to Seouls 

current trade volume with Beijing that 

amounts to 210 billion dollars, said 

Kim Hyunchul, an economic aide to 

President Moon.
Naver CEO Han Seongsook has directly 

criticized Google for not taking enough 

social responsibilities, continuing the 

fierce battle between Google and South 

Koreas main search engine.
As Google must compete fair and square 

in the Korean market, I will ask Google 

openly, Han wrote on the official blog 

of Naver on Thursday. Google must 

reveal its accurate sales in Korea, 

network fee, investment and employment 

status. She attached every single one 

of the materials that might serve as the 

basis for each issue in the form of 

image files, strongly criticizing 

Google.
Google Korea only repeats the answer 

that it is paying taxes, without 

revealing the sales by country, which 

serve as the grounds for the taxes, 

she claimed. Google discloses its 

scale of sales in other countries, such 

as the United Kingdom, but it never 

reveals its sales in Korea during the 

parliamentary inspection in Korea, which 

evokes suspicions.
Han also revealed Navers investment 

status and scale of employments, 

pressuring Google. Naver has hired 8,105 

employees as of October 2017, and she 

wishes to question if Google Korea is 

hiring enough employees to fit its scale 

of sales in Korea, according to Han. The 

industry sees that Google Korea hires 

about 200 people.
Google received 1.2 million dollars 

(about 1.3 billion won) of support from 

the Korean government in 2006 to hire 

personnel as the human resources for 

Research and Development (R&D) in Korea,

 she said. Nevertheless, Google has 

not been revealed if they actually 

hired.
About the part that Google revealed to 

be contributing to Koreas economy by 

supporting startups in Korea, Han said 

that Naver invested 231.8 billion won in 

63 startups and startuppromoting funds 

only in 2017. Google must go beyond 

the superficial mention that it is 

supporting when it comes to social 

contributions, and reveal how much it 

contributes in investments and 

donations, Han said.
The battle between Naver and Google was 

triggered when Naver founder Lee Haejin 

attended the parliamentary inspection on 

Oct. 30 and mentioned the reverse 

discrimination on Korean companies about 

Google. As Google Korea argued on Nov. 

2, We are paying taxes properly and 

hiring hundreds of people in Korea, 

Han rebutted the argument of Google
Around the Banghak Stream Area in Dobong 

District, Seoul are signboards that bear 

words that appear familiar yet 

mysterious, such as Yegam (hunch), 

Soopsok (In the forest) and Yeoulmok 

(rapids). These stores, whose windows 

are covered to prevent pedestrians from 

looking inside, are rundown taverns. 

The pubs are being replaced by local 

community facilities, arts and crafts 

and design workrooms.
Only one pub remains in operation, in 

contrast to the previous 31, thanks to 

the districts campaigns to discourage 

and crackdown adult entertainment since 

April this year, according to Dobong 

District Office on Thursday. The last 

pub will close down next Wednesday and 

reopen business as a cafe
The street will be transformed into a 

cultural avenue that promotes Hangul, 

the Korean alphabet. The motive has been 

taken from cultural heritages found west 

of the stream, including the grave of 

Princess Jeongeui of the Joseon Dynasty, 

the second daughter of King Sejong, who 

created Hangul, the home of Jeon 

Hyeongpil, a scholar who discovered and 

kept the genuine copy of Hunminjeongeum 

and Kim Suyeong Museum.The highlight of 

U.S. President Donald Trumps visit to 

China was his meeting with U.S. and 

Chinese business leaders that followed 

his summit with Chinese President Xi 

Jinping. While the two presidents were 

seated at the rostrum in a dignified 

manner, CEOs of Chinas staterun 

energy company Sinopec and 

telecommunication equipment maker 

Xiaomi, major U.S. firms such as 

Qualcomm, Boeing, Ford and General 

Motors exchanged red memorandums for a 

combined total of 253.5 billion U.S. 

dollars worth of contracts.
Trump, who demanded South Korea and 

Japan purchase large amounts of U.S. 

defense equipment and address trade 

imbalances while jointly responding to 

the North Korean nuclear threats, also 

put into practice his America first 

idea in China. Having received an 

imperial treatment at the Forbidden City 

on Wednesday and an astronomical amount 

of Chinese investment in his country at 

Tiananmen on Thursday, Trump took a step 

back from his criticism of Chinas 

unfair trade practices and reluctance in 

sanctioning North Korea. Xi, who read 

Trumps real intention, used a proper 

strategy.
When Trump said at a treatysigning 

ceremony he does not blame China for the 

unfair trade relationship between 

the two countries, participants gave big 

applauds. After all, who can blame a 

country for being able to take advantage 

of another country for the benefit of 

its citizens. I give China great credit,

 he said. In actuality, I blame past 

[U.S.] administrations for allowing this 

outofcontrol trade deficit to take 

place and to grow. It was a sea change 

from his previous attitude of harshly 

complaining about the U.S.China trade 

imbalances and warned that he would 

designate China as a foreign exchange 

manipulating countries and investigate 

Chinas infringement of U.S. 

intellectual properties.
Stressed the importance of Washington

Beijing relations, Xi said that Chinas 

development has provided many job 

opportunities for Americans and that the 

business pacts signed by entrepreneurs 

from the two countries proved the two 

can have a winwin relationship. Trump 

said the two leaders agreed to take 

concrete steps to address the huge trade 

imbalancesDo not underestimate us. Do 

not try us. I want peace through 

strength, U.S. President Donald Trump 

warned North Korea on Wednesday. In his 

speech to South Koreas National 

Assembly, he has made himself clear that 

he will not allow nuclear provocation by 

Pyongyang. Trump has become the first 

U.S. president to speak at the South 

Korean National Assembly since 1993 when 

former President Bill Clinton visited 

South Korea.
President Trump blamed North Korean 

leader Kim Jong Un, by saying that North 

Korea continues to develop ICBMs to 

threaten the United States itself. This 

would be a fatal miscalculation. This is 

a very different administration than the 

United States has had in the past.
In his 35minute speech, Trump spent 24 

minutes to criticize human rights issues 

and the system in North Korea. By 

referring North Korea as a hell that 

no person deserves or the prison 

state, Trump bashed a deranged belief 

of North Koreans in Kim, malnutrition of 

children and infants, forced labor and 

religious suppression. He called for 

execution of sanctions on North Korea by 

the international community, by saying, 

We call on every nation, including 

China and Russia, to fully implement 

U.N. Security Council resolutions, 

downgrade diplomatic relations with the 

regime, and sever all ties of trade and 

technology.
Trump said South Korea is a staunch ally 

of the United States, by saying, I 

know that the Republic of Korea will be 

a faithful ally of the United States 

very long into the future. He 

refrained from mentioning some key 

negotiation agenda between two 

governments such as FTA deal or sharing 

of defense cost for the United States 

Forces in Korea.
The last stop of Trumps state visit in 

South Korea was the Seoul National 

Cemetery after his visit to the National 

Assembly. After his 2day visit to South 

Korea, he set off for China to meet 

Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump had planned a trip the 

demilitarized zone with Korean President 

Moon Jaein by a helicopter before 

visiting the National Assembly but 

cancelled it due to a bad weather.
President Moon also started his 8day 

tour in the Southeast Asia on Wednesday. 

Moon plans to meet Xi during the Asia

Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 

Summit in Vietnam beginning 

Friday.Shilla Duty Free is gaining 

momentum in expanding its dutyfree 

business overseas, setting an ambitious 

revenue target of 1 trillion won next 

year only from its overseas operations.
Shilla opened its dutyfree store at 

Terminal 4 in Singapores Changi 

International Airport at the end of last 

month, said Hotel Shilla, the operator 

of Shilla Duty Free. With the opening of 

its cosmetics and perfume section last 

month, the retailer now operates 23 

stores in Changi airport, occupying a 

space of 8,000 square meters. The 

retailer has been venturing into 

overseas markets, starting with its 

first overseas store opened in Changi 

airport in 2013.
Terminal 4 is a newly built passenger 

terminal, from which foreign airliners, 

such as Korean Air, Cathay Pacific 

Airways and Vietnam Airlines, operate, 

and is a gateway many passengers from 

Korea, China and Southeast Asian 

countries pass through.
Shilla Duty Free conducted an analysis 

of customers purchasing behavior and 

placed popular cosmetic brands including 

Chanel and Estee Lauder in the front for 

effective display. Hera, a domestic 

cosmetic brand, has been also added to 

the list of brands it sells.
We have taken extra care in choosing 

brands, as the terminal has been 

designed in a way that all passengers 

coming from the immigration desk must 

pass through the dutyfree store, 

Shilla Duty Free said.
The retailer is set to open dutyfree 

store in Hong Kong International Airport 

in Chek Lap Kok in December. Shilla Duty 

Free won the deal in April to operate 

perfume, cosmetics and fashion dutyfree 

stores in the airport. It is also 

running a dutyfree store in Macao 

International Airport, while it opened 

offairport dutyfree shops in Phuket, 

Thailand in November last year and in 

downtown Tokyo in April.
With its dutyfree business expanding 

overseas, Shilla Duty Free is expected 

to record 1 trillion won in sales only 

in overseas markets. From the total 

sales of 3.3 trillion won last year, 500 

billion won came from its overseas 

business.
We expect this years overseas sales to 

be similar to that of last year, a 

Shilla official said. But the number 

will soar from next year once we open 

stores in major airports in Asia.Once 

there were four little girls who
lived in a big, bare house, in the 

country.
They were very poor, but they had the 
happiest times you ever heard of, 

because they
were very rich in everything except just
money. They had a wonderful, wise 

father,
who knew stories to tell, and who taught
them their lessons in such a beautiful 

way
that it was better than play they had a
lovely, merry, kind mother, who was 

never
too tired to help them work or watch 

them
play and they had all the great green
country to play in. There were dark,
shadowy woods, and fields of flowers, 

and
a river. And there was a big barn.

One of the little girls was named 

Louisa.
She was very pretty, and ever so strong
she could run for miles through the 

woods
and not get tired. And she had a 

splendid
brain in her little head it liked 

study, and
it thought interesting thoughts all day 

long.

Louisa liked to sit in a corner by 

herself,
sometimes, and write thoughts in her
diary all the little girls kept 

diaries. She
liked to make up stories out of her own
head, and sometimes she made verses.

When the four little sisters had 

finished
their lessons, and had helped their 

mother
sew and clean, they used to go to the 

big
barn to play and the best play of all 

was 
theatricals. Louisa liked theatricals 

better
than anything.

They made the barn into a theatre, and
the grown people came to see the plays 

they
acted. They used to climb up on the hay
mow for a stage, and the grown people
sat in chairs on the floor. It was great 

fun.
One of the plays they acted was Jack and
the BeanStalk. They had a ladder from
the floor to the loft, and on the ladder 

they
tied a squash vine all the way up to the
loft, to look like the wonderful bean

stalk.
One of the little girls was dressed up 

to
look like Jack, and she acted that part.
When it came to the place in the story
where the giant tried to follow Jack, 

the
little girl cut down the beanstalk, and
down came the giant tumbling from the
loft. The giant was made out of pillows,
with a great, fierce head of paper, and
funny clothes.

Another story that they acted was
Cinderella. They made a wonderful big 

pumpkin
out of the wheelbarrow, trimmed with
yellow paper, and Cinderella rolled away
in it, when the fairy godmother waved 

her
wand.

One other beautiful story they used to
play. It was the story of Pilgrims 

Progress
if you have never heard it, you must
be sure to read it as soon as you can 

read
well enough to understand the old

fashioned
words. The little girls used to put
shells in their hats for a sign they 

were on
a pilgrimage, as the old pilgrims used 

to
do then they made journeys over the 

hill
behind the house, and through the woods,
and down the lanes and when the 

pilgrimage
was over they had apples and nuts to
eat, in the happy land of home.

Louisa loved all these plays, and she
made some of her own and wrote them
down so that the children could act 

them.

But better than fun or writing Louisa
loved her mother, and by and by, as the
little girl began to grow into a big 

girl, she
felt very sad to see her dear mother 

work
so hard. She helped all she could with 

the
housework, but nothing could really help
the tired mother except money she 

needed
money for food and clothes, and some one
grown up, to help in the house. But 

there
never was enough money for these things,
and Louisas mother grew more and more 
weary, and sometimes ill. I cannot tell 

you
how much Louisa suffered over this.

At last, as Louisa thought about it,
she came to care more about helping her
mother and her father and her sisters
than about anything else in all the 

world.
And she began to work very hard to earn
money. She sewed for people, and when
she was a little older she taught some
little girls their lessons, and then she 

wrote
stories for the papers. Every bit of 

money
she earned, except what she had to use,
she gave to her dear family. It helped 

very
much, but it was so little that Louisa 

never
felt as if she were doing anything.

Every year she grew more unselfish, and
every year she worked harder. She liked
writing stories best of all her work, 

but
she did not get much money for them, and
some people told her she was wasting her
time.

At last, one day, a publisher asked
Louisa, who was now a woman, to write
a book for girls. Louisa was not very 

well,
and she was very tired, but she always
said, Ill try, when she had a chance 

to
work so she said, Ill try, to the 
publisher. When she thought about the 

book
she remembered the good times she used
to have with her sisters in the big, 

bare
house in the country. And so she wrote a
story and put all that in it she put 

her
dear mother and her wise father in it, 

and
all the little sisters, and besides the 

jolly
times and the plays, she put the sad, 

hard
times in,the work and worry and going
without things.

When the book was written, she called
it Little Women, and sent it to the 

publisher.

And, children, the little book made
Louisa famous. It was so sweet and
funny and sad and real,like our own
lives,that everybody wanted to read 

it.
Everybody bought it, and much money
came from it. After so many years, 

little
Louisas wish came true she bought a
nice house for her family she sent one
of her sisters to Europe, to study she
gave her father books but best of all, 

she
was able to see to it that the beloved
mother, so tired and so ill, could have 

rest
and happiness. Never again did the dear
mother have to do any hard work, and 
she had pretty things about her all the 

rest
of her life.

Louisa Alcott, for that was Louisas
name, wrote many beautiful books after
this, and she became one of the most
famous women of America. But I think the
most beautiful thing about her is what I
have been telling you that she loved 

her
mother so well that she gave her whole
life to make her happy.
Once the Otter came to the Mousedeer
and said, Friend Mousedeer, will you
please take care of my babies while I go
to the river, to catch fish?

Certainly, said the Mousedeer, go
along.

But when the Otter came back from the
river, with a string of fish, he found 

his
babies crushed flat.

What does this mean, Friend Mouse
deer? he said. Who killed my children
while you were taking care of them?

I am very sorry, said the Mousedeer,
but you know I am Chief Dancer of the
Wardance, and the Woodpecker came
and sounded the wargong, so I danced.
I forgot your children, and trod on 

them.

I shall go to King Solomon, said the
Otter, and you shall be punished.

Soon the Mousedeer was called before
King Solomon.

Did you kill the Otters babies? said
the king.

Yes, your Majesty, said the Mouse
deer, but I did not mean to.

How did it happen? said the king.

Your Majesty knows, said the Mouse
deer, that I am Chief Dancer of the
Wardance. The Woodpecker came and
sounded the wargong, and I had to 

dance
and as I danced I trod on the Otters
children.

Send for the Woodpecker, said King
Solomon. And when the Woodpecker
came, he said to him, Was it you who
sounded the wargong?

Yes, your Majesty, said the 

Woodpecker,
but I had to.

Why? said the king.

Your Majesty knows, said the 

Woodpecker,
that I am Chief Beater of the
Wargong, and I sounded the gong because
I saw the Great Lizard wearing his
sword.

Send for the Great Lizard, said King
Solomon. When the Great Lizard came,
he asked him, Was it you who were 

wearing
your sword?

Yes, your Majesty, said the Great
Lizard but I had to.

Why? said the king.

Your Majesty knows, said the Great
Lizard, that I am Chief Protector of 

the
Sword. I wore my sword because the
Tortoise came wearing his coat of mail.

So the Tortoise was sent for.

Why did you wear your coat of mail?
said the king.

I put it on, your Majesty, said the
Tortoise, because I saw the Kingcrab
trailing his threeedged pike.

Then the Kingcrab was sent for.

Why were you trailing your three
edged pike? said King Solomon.

Because, your Majesty, said the
Kingerab, I saw that the Crayfish had
shouldered his lance.

Immediately the Crayfish was sent for.

Why did you shoulder your lance?
said the king.

Because, your Majesty, said the
Crayfish, I saw the Otter coming down 

to the
river to kill my children.

Oh, said King Solomon, if that is 
the case, the Otter killed the Otters 

children.
And the Mousedeer cannot be
held, by the law of the land!
The Sun and the Wind once had a quarrel
as to which was the stronger. Each
believed himself to be the more 

powerful.
While they were arguing they saw a 

traveler
walking along the country highway,
wearing a great cloak.

Here is a chance to test our strength,
said the Wind let us see which of us 

is
strong enough to make that traveler take
off his cloak the one who can do that 

shall
be acknowledged the more powerful.

Agreed, said the Sun.

Instantly the Wind began to blow he
puffed and tugged at the mans cloak, 

and
raised a storm of hail and rain, to beat 

at
it. But the colder it grew and the more 

it
stormed, the tighter the traveler held 

his
cloak around him. The Wind could not
get it off.

Now it was the Suns turn. He shone 
with all his beams on the mans 

shoulders.
As it grew hotter and hotter, the man
unfastened his cloak then he threw it 

back
at last he took it off! The Sun had 

won.GODLINESS A TALE IN FOUR PARTS

I 

There were always three or four old 

people sitting on the front porch of the 

house or puttering about the garden of 

the Bentley farm. Three of the old 

people were women and sisters to Jesse. 

They were a colorless, soft voiced lot. 

Then there was a silent old man with 

thin white hair who was Jesse?s uncle. 

The farmhouse was built of wood, a board 

outercovering over a framework of logs. 

It was in reality not one house but a 

cluster of houses joined together in a 

rather haphazard manner. Inside, the 

place was full of surprises. One went up 

steps from the living room into the 

dining room and there were always steps 

to be ascended or descended in passing 

from one room to another. At meal times 

the place was like a beehive. At one 

moment all was quiet, then doors began 

to open, feet clattered on stairs, a 

murmur of soft voices arose and people 

appeared from a dozen obscure corners. 

Beside the old people, already 

mentioned, many others lived in the 

Bentley house. There were four hired 

men, a woman named Aunt Callie Beebe, 

who was in charge of the housekeeping, a 

dullwitted girl named Eliza Stoughton, 

who made beds and helped with the 

milking, a boy who worked in the 

stables, and Jesse Bentley himself, the 

owner and overlord of it all. 

By the time the American Civil War had 

been over for twenty years, that part of 

Northern Ohio where the Bentley farms 

lay had begun to emerge from pioneer 

life. Jesse then owned machinery for 

harvesting grain. He had built modern 

barns and most of his land was drained 

with carefully laid tile drain, but in 

order to understand the man we will have 

to go back to an earlier day. 

The Bentley family had been in Northern 

Ohio for several generations before 

Jesse?s time. They came from New York 

State and took up land when the country 

was new and land could be had at a low 

price. For a long time they, in common 

with all the other Middle Western 

people, were very poor. The land they 

had settled upon was heavily wooded and 

covered with fallen logs and underbrush. 

After the long hard labor of clearing 

these away and cutting the timber, there 

were still the stumps to be reckoned 

with. Plows run through the fields 

caught on hidden roots, stones lay all 

about, on the low places water gathered, 

and the young corn turned yellow, 

sickened and died. 

When Jesse Bentley?s father and brothers 

had come into their ownership of the 

place, much of the harder part of the 

work of clearing had been done, but they 

clung to old traditions and worked like 

driven animals. They lived as 

practically all of the farming people of 

the time lived. In the spring and 

through most of the winter the highways 

leading into the town of Winesburg were 

a sea of mud. The four young men of the 

family worked hard all day in the 

fields, they ate heavily of coarse, 

greasy food, and at night slept like 

tired beasts on beds of straw. Into 

their lives came little that was not 

coarse and brutal and outwardly they 

were themselves coarse and brutal. On 

Saturday afternoons they hitched a team 

of horses to a threeseated wagon and 

went off to town. In town they stood 

about the stoves in the stores talking 

to other farmers or to the store 

keepers. They were dressed in overalls 

and in the winter wore heavy coats that 

were flecked with mud. Their hands as 

they stretched them out to the heat of 

the stoves were cracked and red. It was 

difficult for them to talk and so they 

for the most part kept silent. When they 

had bought meat, flour, sugar, and salt, 

they went into one of the Winesburg 

saloons and drank beer. Under the 

influence of drink the naturally strong 

lusts of their natures, kept suppressed 

by the heroic labor of breaking up new 

ground, were released. A kind of crude 

and animallike poetic fervor took 

possession of them. On the road home 

they stood up on the wagon seats and 

shouted at the stars. Sometimes they 

fought long and bitterly and at other 

times they broke forth into songs. Once 

Enoch Bentley, the older one of the 

boys, struck his father, old Tom 

Bentley, with the butt of a teamster?s 

whip, and the old man seemed likely to 

die. For days Enoch lay hid in the straw 

in the loft of the stable ready to flee 

if the result of his momentary passion 

turned out to be murder. He was kept 

alive with food brought by his mother, 

who also kept him informed of the 

injured man?s condition. When all turned 

out well he emerged from his hiding 

place and went back to the work of 

clearing land as though nothing had 

happened. 

The Civil War brought a sharp turn to 

the fortunes of the Bentleys and was 

responsible for the rise of the youngest 

son, Jesse. Enoch, Edward, Harry, and 

Will Bentley all enlisted and before the 

long war ended they were all killed. For 

a time after they went away to the 

South, old Tom tried to run the place, 

but he was not successful. When the last 

of the four had been killed he sent word 

to Jesse that he would have to come 

home. 

Then the mother, who had not been well 

for a year, died suddenly, and the 

father became altogether discouraged. He 

talked of selling the farm and moving 

into town. All day he went about shaking 

his head and muttering. The work in the 

fields was neglected and weeds grew high 

in the corn. Old Tim hired men but he 

did not use them intelligently. When 

they had gone away to the fields in the 

morning he wandered into the woods and 

sat down on a log. Sometimes he forgot 

to come home at night and one of the 

daughters had to go in search of him. 

When Jesse Bentley came home to the farm 

and began to take charge of things he 

was a slight, sensitivelooking man of 

twentytwo. At eighteen he had left home 

to go to school to become a scholar and 

eventually to become a minister of the 

Presbyterian Church. All through his 

boyhood he had been what in our country 

was called an ?odd sheep? and had not 

got on with his brothers. Of all the 

family only his mother had understood 

him and she was now dead. When he came 

home to take charge of the farm, that 

had at that time grown to more than six 

hundred acres, everyone on the farms 

about and in the nearby town of 

Winesburg smiled at the idea of his 

trying to handle the work that had been 

done by his four strong brothers. 

There was indeed good cause to smile. By 

the standards of his day Jesse did not 

look like a man at all. He was small and 

very slender and womanish of body and, 

true to the traditions of young 

ministers, wore a long black coat and a 

narrow black string tie. The neighbors 

were amused when they saw him, after the 

years away, and they were even more 

amused when they saw the woman he had 

married in the city. 

As a matter of fact, Jesse?s wife did 

soon go under. That was perhaps Jesse?s 

fault. A farm in Northern Ohio in the 

hard years after the Civil War was no 

place for a delicate woman, and 

Katherine Bentley was delicate. Jesse 

was hard with her as he was with 

everybody about him in those days. She 

tried to do such work as all the 

neighbor women about her did and he let 

her go on without interference. She 

helped to do the milking and did part of 

the housework she made the beds for the 

men and prepared their food. For a year 

she worked every day from sunrise until 

late at night and then after giving 

birth to a child she died. 

As for Jesse Bentley?although he was a 

delicately built man there was something 

within him that could not easily be 

killed. He had brown curly hair and grey 

eyes that were at times hard and direct, 

at times wavering and uncertain. Not 

only was he slender but he was also 

short of stature. His mouth was like the 

mouth of a sensitive and very determined 

child. Jesse Bentley was a fanatic. He 

was a man born out of his time and place 

and for this he suffered and made others 

suffer. Never did he succeed in getting 

what he wanted out of fife and he did 

not know what he wanted. Within a very 

short time after he came home to the 

Bentley farm he made everyone there a 

little afraid of him, and his wife, who 

should have been close to him as his 

mother had been, was afraid also. At the 

end of two weeks after his coming, old 

Tom Bentley made over to him the entire 

ownership of the place and retired into 

the background. Everyone retired into 

the background. In spite of his youth 

and inexperience, Jesse had the trick of 

mastering the souls of his people. He 

was so in earnest in everything he did 

and said that no one understood him. He 

made everyone on the farm work as they 

had never worked before and yet there 

was no joy in the work. If things went 

well they went well for Jesse and never 

for the people who were his dependents. 

Like a thousand other strong men who 

have come into the world here in America 

in these later times, Jesse was but half 

strong. He could master others but he 

could not master himself. The running of 

the farm as it had never been run before 

was easy for him. When he came home from 

Cleveland where he had been in school, 

he shut himself off from all of his 

people and began to make plans. He 

thought about the farm night and day and 

that made him successful. Other men on 

the farms about him worked too hard and 

were too fired to think, but to think of 

the farm and to be everlastingly making 

plans for its success was a relief to 

Jesse. It partially satisfied something 

in his passionate nature. Immediately 

after he came home he had a wing built 

on to the old house and in a large room 

facing the west he had windows that 

looked into the barnyard and other 

windows that looked off across the 

fields. By the window he sat down to 

think. Hour after hour and day after day 

he sat and looked over the land and 

thought out his new place in life. The 

passionate burning thing in his nature 

flamed up and his eyes became hard. He 

wanted to make the farm produce as no 

farm in his state had ever produced 

before and then he wanted something 

else. It was the indefinable hunger 

within that made his eyes waver and that 

kept him always more and more silent 

before people. He would have given much 

to achieve peace and in him was a fear 

that peace was the thing he could not 

achieve. 

All over his body Jesse Bentley was 

alive. In his small frame was gathered 

the force of a long line of strong men. 

He had always been extraordinarily alive 

when he was a small boy on the farm and 

later when he was a young man in school. 

In the school he had studied and thought 

of God and the Bible with his whole mind 

and heart. As time passed and he grew to 

know people better, he began to think of 

himself as an extraordinary man, one set 

apart from his fellows. He wanted 

terribly to make his life a thing of 

great importance, and as he looked about 

at his fellow men and saw how like clods 

they lived it seemed to him that he 

could not bear to become also such a 

clod. Although in his absorption in 

himself and in his own destiny he was 

blind to the fact that his young wife 

was doing a strong woman?s work even 

after she had become large with child 

and that she was killing herself in his 

service, he did not intend to be unkind 

to her. When his father, who was old and 

twisted with toil, made over to him the 

ownership of the farm and seemed content 

to creep away to a corner and wait for 

death, he shrugged his shoulders and 

dismissed the old man from his mind. 

In the room by the window overlooking 

the land that had come down to him sat 

Jesse thinking of his own affairs. In 

the stables he could hear the tramping 

of his horses and the restless movement 

of his cattle. Away in the fields he 

could see other cattle wandering over 

green hills. The voices of men, his men 

who worked for him, came in to him 

through the window. From the milkhouse 

there was the steady thump, thump of a 

churn being manipulated by the half

witted girl, Eliza Stoughton. Jesse?s 

mind went back to the men of Old 

Testament days who had also owned lands 

and herds. He remembered how God had 

come down out of the skies and talked to 

these men and he wanted God to notice 

and to talk to him also. A kind of 

feverish boyish eagerness to in some way 

achieve in his own life the flavor of 

significance that had hung over these 

men took possession of him. Being a 

prayerful man he spoke of the matter 

aloud to God and the sound of his own 

words strengthened and fed his 

eagerness. 

?I am a new kind of man come into 

possession of these fields,? he 

declared. ?Look upon me, O God, and look 

Thou also upon my neighbors and all the 

men who have gone before me here! O God, 

create in me another Jesse, like that 

one of old, to rule over men and to be 

the father of sons who shall be rulers!? 

Jesse grew excited as he talked aloud 

and jumping to his feet walked up and 

down in the room. In fancy he saw 

himself living in old times and among 

old peoples. The land that lay stretched 

out before him became of vast 

significance, a place peopled by his 

fancy with a new race of men sprung from 

himself. It seemed to him that in his 

day as in those other and older days, 

kingdoms might be created and new 

impulses given to the lives of men by 

the power of God speaking through a 

chosen servant. He longed to be such a 

servant. ?It is God?s work I have come 

to the land to do,? he declared in a 

loud voice and his short figure 

straightened and he thought that 

something like a halo of Godly approval 

hung over him. 

It will perhaps be somewhat difficult 

for the men and women of a later day to 

understand Jesse Bentley. In the last 

fifty years a vast change has taken 

place in the lives of our people. A 

revolution has in fact taken place. The 

coming of industrialism, attended by all 

the roar and rattle of affairs, the 

shrill cries of millions of new voices 

that have come among us from overseas, 

the going and coming of trains, the 

growth of cities, the building of the 

interurban car lines that weave in and 

out of towns and past farmhouses, and 

now in these later days the coming of 

the automobiles has worked a tremendous 

change in the lives and in the habits of 

thought of our people of MidAmerica. 

Books, badly imagined and written though 

they may be in the hurry of our times, 

are in every household, magazines 

circulate by the millions of copies, 

newspapers are everywhere. In our day a 

farmer standing by the stove in the 

store in his village has his mind filled 

to overflowing with the words of other 

men. The newspapers and the magazines 

have pumped him full. Much of the old 

brutal ignorance that had in it also a 

kind of beautiful childlike innocence is 

gone forever. The farmer by the stove is 

brother to the men of the cities, and if 

you listen you will find him talking as 

glibly and as senselessly as the best 

city man of us all. 

In Jesse Bentley?s time and in the 

country districts of the whole Middle 

West in the years after the Civil War it 

was not so. Men labored too hard and 

were too tired to read. In them was no 

desire for words printed upon paper. As 

they worked in the fields, vague, half

formed thoughts took possession of them. 

They believed in God and in God?s power 

to control their lives. In the little 

Protestant churches they gathered on 

Sunday to hear of God and his works. The 

churches were the center of the social 

and intellectual life of the times. The 

figure of God was big in the hearts of 

men. 

And so, having been born an imaginative 

child and having within him a great 

intellectual eagerness, Jesse Bentley 

had turned wholeheartedly toward God. 

When the war took his brothers away, he 

saw the hand of God in that. When his 

father became ill and could no longer 

attend to the running of the farm, he 

took that also as a sign from God. In 

the city, when the word came to him, he 

walked about at night through the 

streets thinking of the matter and when 

he had come home and had got the work on 

the farm well under way, he went again 

at night to walk through the forests and 

over the low hills and to think of God. 

As he walked the importance of his own 

figure in some divine plan grew in his 

mind. He grew avaricious and was 

impatient that the farm contained only 

six hundred acres. Kneeling in a fence 

corner at the edge of some meadow, he 

sent his voice abroad into the silence 

and looking up he saw the stars shining 

down at him. 

One evening, some months after his 

father?s death, and when his wife 

Katherine was expecting at any moment to 

be laid abed of childbirth, Jesse left 

his house and went for a long walk. The 

Bentley farm was situated in a tiny 

valley watered by Wine Creek, and Jesse 

walked along the banks of the stream to 

the end of his own land and on through 

the fields of his neighbors. As he 

walked the valley broadened and then 

narrowed again. Great open stretches of 

field and wood lay before him. The moon 

came out from behind clouds, and, 

climbing a low hill, he sat down to 

think. 

Jesse thought that as the true servant 

of God the entire stretch of country 

through which he had walked should have 

come into his possession. He thought of 

his dead brothers and blamed them that 

they had not worked harder and achieved 

more. Before him in the moonlight the 

tiny stream ran down over stones, and he 

began to think of the men of old times 

who like himself had owned flocks and 

lands. 

A fantastic impulse, half fear, half 

greediness, took possession of Jesse 

Bentley. He remembered how in the old 

Bible story the Lord had appeared to 

that other Jesse and told him to send 

his son David to where Saul and the men 

of Israel were fighting the Philistines 

in the Valley of Elah. Into Jesse?s mind 

came the conviction that all of the Ohio 

farmers who owned land in the valley of 

Wine Creek were Philistines and enemies 

of God. ?Suppose,? he whispered to 

himself, ?there should come from among 

them one who, like Goliath the 

Philistine of Gath, could defeat me and 

take from me my possessions.? In fancy 

he felt the sickening dread that he 

thought must have lain heavy on the 

heart of Saul before the coming of 

David. Jumping to his feet, he began to 

run through the night. As he ran he 

called to God. His voice carried far 

over the low hills. ?Jehovah of Hosts,? 

he cried, ?send to me this night out of 

the womb of Katherine, a son. Let Thy 

grace alight upon me. Send me a son to 

be called David who shall help me to 

pluck at last all of these lands out of 

the hands of the Philistines and turn 

them to Thy service and to the building 

of Thy kingdom on earth.? GODLINESS A 

TALE IN FOUR PARTS 

II 


David Hardy of Winesburg, Ohio, was the 

grandson of Jesse Bentley, the owner of 

Bentley farms. When he was twelve years 

old he went to the old Bentley place to 

live. His mother, Louise Bentley, the 

girl who came into the world on that 

night when Jesse ran through the fields 

crying to God that he be given a son, 

had grown to womanhood on the farm and 

had married young John Hardy of 

Winesburg, who became a banker. Louise 

and her husband did not live happily 

together and everyone agreed that she 

was to blame. She was a small woman with 

sharp grey eyes and black hair. From 

childhood she had been inclined to fits 

of temper and when not angry she was 

often morose and silent. In Winesburg it 

was said that she drank. Her husband, 

the banker, who was a careful, shrewd 

man, tried hard to make her happy. When 

he began to make money he bought for her 

a large brick house on Elm Street in 

Winesburg and he was the first man in 

that town to keep a manservant to drive 

his wife?s carriage. 

But Louise could not be made happy. She 

flew into half insane fits of temper 

during which she was sometimes silent, 

sometimes noisy and quarrelsome. She 

swore and cried out in her anger. She 

got a knife from the kitchen and 

threatened her husband?s life. Once she 

deliberately set fire to the house, and 

often she hid herself away for days in 

her own room and would see no one. Her 

life, lived as a half recluse, gave rise 

to all sorts of stories concerning her. 

It was said that she took drugs and that 

she hid herself away from people because 

she was often so under the influence of 

drink that her condition could not be 

concealed. Sometimes on summer 

afternoons she came out of the house and 

got into her carriage. Dismissing the 

driver she took the reins in her own 

hands and drove off at top speed through 

the streets. If a pedestrian got in her 

way she drove straight ahead and the 

frightened citizen had to escape as best 

he could. To the people of the town it 

seemed as though she wanted to run them 

down. When she had driven through 

several streets, tearing around corners 

and beating the horses with the whip, 

she drove off into the country. On the 

country roads after she had gotten out 

of sight of the houses she let the 

horses slow down to a walk and her wild, 

reckless mood passed. She became 

thoughtful and muttered words. Sometimes 

tears came into her eyes. And then when 

she came back into town she again drove 

furiously through the quiet streets. But 

for the influence of her husband and the 

respect he inspired in people?s minds 

she would have been arrested more than 

once by the town marshal. 

Young David Hardy grew up in the house 

with this woman and as can well be 

imagined there was not much joy in his 

childhood. He was too young then to have 

opinions of his own about people, but at 

times it was difficult for him not to 

have very definite opinions about the 

woman who was his mother. David was 

always a quiet, orderly boy and for a 

long time was thought by the people of 

Winesburg to be something of a dullard. 

His eyes were brown and as a child he 

had a habit of looking at things and 

people a long time without appearing to 

see what he was looking at. When he 

heard his mother spoken of harshly or 

when he overheard her berating his 

father, he was frightened and ran away 

to hide. Sometimes he could not find a 

hiding place and that confused him. 

Turning his face toward a tree or if he 

was indoors toward the wall, he closed 

his eyes and tried not to think of 

anything. He had a habit of talking 

aloud to himself, and early in life a 

spirit of quiet sadness often took 

possession of him. 

On the occasions when David went to 

visit his grandfather on the Bentley 

farm, he was altogether contented and 

happy. Often he wished that he would 

never have to go back to town and once 

when he had come home from the farm 

after a long visit, something happened 

that had a lasting effect on his mind. 

David had come back into town with one 

of the hired men. The man was in a hurry 

to go about his own affairs and left the 

boy at the head of the street in which 

the Hardy house stood. It was early dusk 

of a fall evening and the sky was 

overcast with clouds. Something happened 

to David. He could not bear to go into 

the house where his mother and father 

lived, and on an impulse he decided to 

run away from home. He intended to go 

back to the farm and to his grandfather, 

but lost his way and for hours he 

wandered weeping and frightened on 

country roads. It started to rain and 

lightning flashed in the sky. The boy?s 

imagination was excited and he fancied 

that he could see and hear strange 

things in the darkness. Into his mind 

came the conviction that he was walking 

and running in some terrible void where 

no one had ever been before. The 

darkness about him seemed limitless. The 

sound of the wind blowing in trees was 

terrifying. When a team of horses 

approached along the road in which he 

walked he was frightened and climbed a 

fence. Through a field he ran until he 

came into another road and getting upon 

his knees felt of the soft ground with 

his fingers. But for the figure of his 

grandfather, whom he was afraid he would 

never find in the darkness, he thought 

the world must be altogether empty. When 

his cries were heard by a farmer who was 

walking home from town and he was 

brought back to his father?s house, he 

was so tired and excited that he did not 

know what was happening to him. 

By chance David?s father knew that he 

had disappeared. On the street he had 

met the farm hand from the Bentley place 

and knew of his son?s return to town. 

When the boy did not come home an alarm 

was set up and John Hardy with several 

men of the town went to search the 

country. The report that David had been 

kidnapped ran about through the streets 

of Winesburg. When he came home there 

were no lights in the house, but his 

mother appeared and clutched him eagerly 

in her arms. David thought she had 

suddenly become another woman. He could 

not believe that so delightful a thing 

had happened. With her own hands Louise 

Hardy bathed his tired young body and 

cooked him food. She would not let him 

go to bed but, when he had put on his 

nightgown, blew out the lights and sat 

down in a chair to hold him in her arms. 

For an hour the woman sat in the 

darkness and held her boy. All the time 

she kept talking in a low voice. David 

could not understand what had so changed 

her. Her habitually dissatisfied face 

had become, he thought, the most 

peaceful and lovely thing he had ever 

seen. When he began to weep she held him 

more and more tightly. On and on went 

her voice. It was not harsh or shrill as 

when she talked to her husband, but was 

like rain falling on trees. Presently 

men began coming to the door to report 

that he had not been found, but she made 

him hide and be silent until she had 

sent them away. He thought it must be a 

game his mother and the men of the town 

were playing with him and laughed 

joyously. Into his mind came the thought 

that his having been lost and frightened 

in the darkness was an altogether 

unimportant matter. He thought that he 

would have been willing to go through 

the frightful experience a thousand 

times to be sure of finding at the end 

of the long black road a thing so lovely 

as his mother had suddenly become. 


During the last years of young David?s 

boyhood he saw his mother but seldom and 

she became for him just a woman with 

whom he had once lived. Still he could 

not get her figure out of his mind and 

as he grew older it became more 

definite. When he was twelve years old 

he went to the Bentley farm to live. Old 

Jesse came into town and fairly demanded 

that he be given charge of the boy. The 

old man was excited and determined on 

having his own way. He talked to John 

Hardy in the office of the Winesburg 

Savings Bank and then the two men went 

to the house on Elm Street to talk with 

Louise. They both expected her to make 

trouble but were mistaken. She was very 

quiet and when Jesse had explained his 

mission and had gone on at some length 

about the advantages to come through 

having the boy out of doors and in the 

quiet atmosphere of the old farmhouse, 

she nodded her head in approval. ?It is 

an atmosphere not corrupted by my 

presence,? she said sharply. Her 

shoulders shook and she seemed about to 

fly into a fit of temper. ?It is a place 

for a man child, although it was never a 

place for me,? she went on. ?You never 

wanted me there and of course the air of 

your house did me no good. It was like 

poison in my blood but it will be 

different with him.? 

Louise turned and went out of the room, 

leaving the two men to sit in 

embarrassed silence. As very often 

happened she later stayed in her room 

for days. Even when the boy?s clothes 

were packed and he was taken away she 

did not appear. The loss of her son made 

a sharp break in her life and she seemed 

less inclined to quarrel with her 

husband. John Hardy thought it had all 

turned out very well indeed. 

And so young David went to live in the 

Bentley farmhouse with Jesse. Two of the 

old farmer?s sisters were alive and 

still lived in the house. They were 

afraid of Jesse and rarely spoke when he 

was about. One of the women who had been 

noted for her flaming red hair when she 

was younger was a born mother and became 

the boy?s caretaker. Every night when he 

had gone to bed she went into his room 

and sat on the floor until he fell 

asleep. When he became drowsy she became 

bold and whispered things that he later 

thought he must have dreamed. 

Her soft low voice called him endearing 

names and he dreamed that his mother had 

come to him and that she had changed so 

that she was always as she had been that 

time after he ran away. He also grew 

bold and reaching out his hand stroked 

the face of the woman on the floor so 

that she was ecstatically happy. 

Everyone in the old house became happy 

after the boy went there. The hard 

insistent thing in Jesse Bentley that 

had kept the people in the house silent 

and timid and that had never been 

dispelled by the presence of the girl 

Louise was apparently swept away by the 

coming of the boy. It was as though God 

had relented and sent a son to the man. 

The man who had proclaimed himself the 

only true servant of God in all the 

valley of Wine Creek, and who had wanted 

God to send him a sign of approval by 

way of a son out of the womb of 

Katherine, began to think that at last 

his prayers had been answered. Although 

he was at that time only fiftyfive 

years old he looked seventy and was worn 

out with much thinking and scheming. The 

effort he had made to extend his land 

holdings had been successful and there 

were few farms in the valley that did 

not belong to him, but until David came 

he was a bitterly disappointed man. 

There were two influences at work in 

Jesse Bentley and all his life his mind 

had been a battleground for these 

influences. First there was the old 

thing in him. He wanted to be a man of 

God and a leader among men of God. His 

walking in the fields and through the 

forests at night had brought him close 

to nature and there were forces in the 

passionately religious man that ran out 

to the forces in nature. The 

disappointment that had come to him when 

a daughter and not a son had been born 

to Katherine had fallen upon him like a 

blow struck by some unseen hand and the 

blow had somewhat softened his egotism. 

He still believed that God might at any 

moment make himself manifest out of the 

winds or the clouds, but he no longer 

demanded such recognition. Instead he 

prayed for it. Sometimes he was 

altogether doubtful and thought God had 

deserted the world. He regretted the 

fate that had not let him live in a 

simpler and sweeter time when at the 

beckoning of some strange cloud in the 

sky men left their lands and houses and 

went forth into the wilderness to create 

new races. While he worked night and day 

to make his farms more productive and to 

extend his holdings of land, he 

regretted that he could not use his own 

restless energy in the building of 

temples, the slaying of unbelievers and 

in general in the work of glorifying 

God?s name on earth. 

That is what Jesse hungered for and then 

also he hungered for something else. He 

had grown into maturity in America in 

the years after the Civil War and he, 

like all men of his time, had been 

touched by the deep influences that were 

at work in the country during those 

years when modem industrialism was being 

born. He began to buy machines that 

would permit him to do the work of the 

farms while employing fewer men and he 

sometimes thought that if he were a 

younger man he would give up farming 

altogether and start a factory in 

Winesburg for the making of machinery. 

Jesse formed the habit of reading 

newspapers and magazines. He invented a 

machine for the making of fence out of 

wire. Faintly he realized that the 

atmosphere of old times and places that 

he had always cultivated in his own mind 

was strange and foreign to the thing 

that was growing up in the minds of 

others. The beginning of the most 

materialistic age in the history of the 

world, when wars would be fought without 

patriotism, when men would forget God 

and only pay attention to moral 

standards, when the will to power would 

replace the will to serve and beauty 

would be wellnigh forgotten in the 

terrible headlong rush of mankind toward 

the acquiring of possessions, was 

telling its story to Jesse the man of 

God as it was to the men about him. The 

greedy thing in him wanted to make money 

faster than it could be made by tilling 

the land. More than once he went into 

Winesburg to talk with his soninlaw 

John Hardy about it. ?You are a banker 

and you will have chances I never had,? 

he said and his eyes shone. ?I am 

thinking about it all the time. Big 

things are going to be done in the 

country and there will be more money to 

be made than I ever dreamed of. You get 

into it. I wish I were younger and had 

your chance.? Jesse Bentley walked up 

and down in the bank office and grew 

more and more excited as he talked. At 

one time in his life he had been 

threatened with paralysis and his left 

side remained somewhat weakened. As he 

talked his left eyelid twitched. Later 

when he drove back home and when night 

came on and the stars came out it was 

harder to get back the old feeling of a 

close and personal God who lived in the 

sky overhead and who might at any moment 

reach out his hand, touch him on the 

shoulder, and appoint for him some 

heroic task to be done. Jesse?s mind was 

fixed upon the things read in newspapers 

and magazines, on fortunes to be made 

almost without effort by shrewd men who 

bought and sold. For him the coming of 

the boy David did much to bring back 

with renewed force the old faith and it 

seemed to him that God had at last 

looked with favor upon him. 

As for the boy on the farm, life began 

to reveal itself to him in a thousand 

new and delightful ways. The kindly 

attitude of all about him expanded his 

quiet nature and he lost the half timid, 

hesitating manner he had always had with 

his people. At night when he went to bed 

after a long day of adventures in the 

stables, in the fields, or driving about 

from farm to farm with his grandfather, 

he wanted to embrace everyone in the 

house. If Sherley Bentley, the woman who 

came each night to sit on the floor by 

his bedside, did not appear at once, he 

went to the head of the stairs and 

shouted, his young voice ringing through 

the narrow halls where for so long there 

had been a tradition of silence. In the 

morning when he awoke and lay still in 

bed, the sounds that came in to him 

through the windows filled him with 

delight. He thought with a shudder of 

the life in the house in Winesburg and 

of his mother?s angry voice that had 

always made him tremble. There in the 

country all sounds were pleasant sounds. 

When he awoke at dawn the barnyard back 

of the house also awoke. In the house 

people stirred about. Eliza Stoughton 

the halfwitted girl was poked in the 

ribs by a farm hand and giggled noisily, 

in some distant field a cow bawled and 

was answered by the cattle in the 

stables, and one of the farm hands spoke 

sharply to the horse he was grooming by 

the stable door. David leaped out of bed 

and ran to a window. All of the people 

stirring about excited his mind, and he 

wondered what his mother was doing in 

the house in town. 

From the windows of his own room he 

could not see directly into the barnyard 

where the farm hands had now all 

assembled to do the morning shores, but 

he could hear the voices of the men and 

the neighing of the horses. When one of 

the men laughed, he laughed also. 

Leaning out at the open window, he 

looked into an orchard where a fat sow 

wandered about with a litter of tiny 

pigs at her heels. Every morning he 

counted the pigs. ?Four, five, six, 

seven,? he said slowly, wetting his 

finger and making straight up and down 

marks on the window ledge. David ran to 

put on his trousers and shirt. A 

feverish desire to get out of doors took 

possession of him. Every morning he made 

such a noise coming down stairs that 

Aunt Callie, the housekeeper, declared 

he was trying to tear the house down. 

When he had run through the long old 

house, shutting the doors behind him 

with a bang, he came into the barnyard 

and looked about with an amazed air of 

expectancy. It seemed to him that in 

such a place tremendous things might 

have happened during the night. The farm 

hands looked at him and laughed. Henry 

Strader, an old man who had been on the 

farm since Jesse came into possession 

and who before David?s time had never 

been known to make a joke, made the same 

joke every morning. It amused David so 

that he laughed and clapped his hands. 

?See, come here and look,? cried the old 

man. ?Grandfather Jesse?s white mare has 

tom the black stocking she wears on her 

foot.? 

Day after day through the long summer, 

Jesse Bentley drove from farm to farm up 

and down the valley of Wine Creek, and 

his grandson went with him. They rode in 

a comfortable old phaeton drawn by the 

white horse. The old man scratched his 

thin white beard and talked to himself 

of his plans for increasing the 

productiveness of the fields they 

visited and of God?s part in the plans 

all men made. Sometimes he looked at 

David and smiled happily and then for a 

long time he appeared to forget the 

boy?s existence. More and more every day 

now his mind turned back again to the 

dreams that had filled his mind when he 

had first come out of the city to live 

on the land. One afternoon he startled 

David by letting his dreams take entire 

possession of him. With the boy as a 

witness, he went through a ceremony and 

brought about an accident that nearly 

destroyed the companionship that was 

growing up between them. 

Jesse and his grandson were driving in a 

distant part of the valley some miles 

from home. A forest came down to the 

road and through the forest Wine Creek 

wriggled its way over stones toward a 

distant river. All the afternoon Jesse 

had been in a meditative mood and now he 

began to talk. His mind went back to the 

night when he had been frightened by 

thoughts of a giant that might come to 

rob and plunder him of his possessions, 

and again as on that night when he had 

run through the fields crying for a son, 

he became excited to the edge of 

insanity. Stopping the horse he got out 

of the buggy and asked David to get out 

also. The two climbed over a fence and 

walked along the bank of the stream. The 

boy paid no attention to the muttering 

of his grandfather, but ran along beside 

him and wondered what was going to 

happen. When a rabbit jumped up and ran 

away through the woods, he clapped his 

hands and danced with delight. He looked 

at the tall trees and was sorry that he 

was not a little animal to climb high in 

the air without being frightened. 

Stooping, he picked up a small stone and 

threw it over the head of his 

grandfather into a clump of bushes. ?

Wake up, little animal. Go and climb to 

the top of the trees,? he shouted in a 

shrill voice. 

Jesse Bentley went along under the trees 

with his head bowed and with his mind in 

a ferment. His earnestness affected the 

boy, who presently became silent and a 

little alarmed. Into the old man?s mind 

had come the notion that now he could 

bring from God a word or a sign out of 

the sky, that the presence of the boy 

and man on their knees in some lonely 

spot in the forest would make the 

miracle he had been waiting for almost 

inevitable. ?It was in just such a place 

as this that other David tended the 

sheep when his father came and told him 

to go down unto Saul,? he muttered. 

Taking the boy rather roughly by the 

shoulder, he climbed over a fallen log 

and when he had come to an open place 

among the trees he dropped upon his 

knees and began to pray in a loud voice. 

A kind of terror he had never known 

before took possession of David. 

Crouching beneath a tree he watched the 

man on the ground before him and his own 

knees began to tremble. It seemed to him 

that he was in the presence not only of 

his grandfather but of someone else, 

someone who might hurt him, someone who 

was not kindly but dangerous and brutal. 

He began to cry and reaching down picked 

up a small stick, which he held tightly 

gripped in his fingers. When Jesse 

Bentley, absorbed in his own idea, 

suddenly arose and advanced toward him, 

his terror grew until his whole body 

shook. In the woods an intense silence 

seemed to lie over everything and 

suddenly out of the silence came the old 

man?s harsh and insistent voice. 

Gripping the boy?s shoulders, Jesse 

turned his face to the sky and shouted. 

The whole left side of his face twitched 

and his hand on the boy?s shoulder 

twitched also. ?Make a sign to me, God,? 

he cried. ?Here I stand with the boy 

David. Come down to me out of the sky 

and make Thy presence known to me.? 

With a cry of fear, David turned and, 

shaking himself loose from the hands 

that held him, ran away through the 

forest. He did not believe that the man 

who turned up his face and in a harsh 

voice shouted at the sky was his 

grandfather at all. The man did not look 

like his grandfather. The conviction 

that something strange and terrible had 

happened, that by some miracle a new and 

dangerous person had come into the body 

of the kindly old man,
